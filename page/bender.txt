Time Keeps on Slippin’
----------------------

Bender, being God isn’t easy. If you do too much, people get dependent
on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light
touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket. Our love isn’t any different
from yours, except it’s hotter, because I’m involved. You, minion. Lift
my arm. AFTER HIM! Soon enough. No! I want to live! There are still too
many things I don’t own!

-   When the lights go out, it’s nobody’s business what goes on between
    two consenting adults.
-   Soon enough.
-   Kids have names?
-   Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn’t you just get me the death penalty?

Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your
children, and hitting them? You wouldn’t. Ask anyway! So I really am
important? How I feel when I’m http://google.com is correct? Can I 
use the gun? You don’t know how to do any of those.

## Mother’s Day

And from now on you’re all named bender@example.com, they’ll be killed
on our doorstep! And there’s no trash pickup until January 3rd. Well
I’da done better, but it’s plum hard pleading a case while awaiting
trial for that there incompetence. I am Singing Wind, Chief of the
Martians. We’ll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we’ll
go home. I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem
telling his most intimate friends all about him.

* bite my shiny metal ass.
* say what?

## Space Pilot 3000

Calculon is gonna kill us and it’s all everybody else’s fault! How much
did you make me? Son, as your lawyer, I declare y’all are in a 12-piece
bucket o’ trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community
service cleanin’ up that ol’ mess you caused. Please, Don-Bot… look into
your hard drive, and open your mercy file! Yes! In your face, Gandhi!
