Devil’s Hands are Idle Playthings
=================================

Really?! Yes! In your face, Gandhi! Oh, you’re a dollar naughtier than
most. If rubbin’ frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don’t wanna
be right. My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book ‘Earth in
the Balance’, and the much more popular ‘Harry Potter and the Balance
of Earth’, we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark
wizards. Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry’s worm
infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them.

## Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?

This is the worst part. The calm before the battle. My fellow
Earthicans, as I have explained in my book ‘Earth in the Balance’, and
the much more popular ‘Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth’, we need
to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards. Oh, all
right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing
some old man. For the last time, I don’t like lilacs! Your ‘first’ wife
was the one who liked lilacs! Shut up and take my money@example.com!

-   Alright, let’s mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship.
    Clamps, burn down the crew.
-   Meh.
-   We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and
    bruised.
-   No, of course not. It was… uh… porno. Yeah, that’s it.

That’s right, baby. I ain’t your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so
much. You even love anyone pretending to be him! We need rest. The
spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised. Why would I want
to know that?

## The Route of All Evil

Eeeee! Now say “nuclear wessels”! It may comfort you to know that Fry’s
death took only fifteen seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that it
felt to him like fifteen years. And it goes without saying, it caused
him to empty his bowels. And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet,
Nibbler, who’s gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go. The
toilet. Meh. No! The cat shelter’s on to me.

* Eeeee! Now say “nuclear wessels”!
* Well, then good news! It’s a suppository.
* No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires!
* It doesn’t look so shiny to me.

## Obsoletely Fabulous

Fry, we have a crate to deliver. How much did you make me? I’ve been
there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants.
What am I, the pope? It doesn’t look so shiny to me. You guys go on
without me! I’m going to go… look for more stuff to steal! She also
liked to shut up!
