<h1>Fry and the Slurm Factory</h1>
<p>Do a flip! Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock. We need rest.  The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised. Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars.</p>
<h2>A Taste of Freedom</h2>
<p>You are the last hope of the universe. I'm Santa Claus! I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that.</p>
<ul>
<li>Why, those are the Grunka-Lunkas! They work here in the Slurm factory.</li>
<li>You don't know how to do any of those.</li>
<li>Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Three Hundred Big Boys</h3>
<p>I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that. Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding Machine.  He struck a chord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree. Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most. For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist! WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT! Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold the charge and the reception isn't very&hellip;</p>
<h4>Love's Labors Lost in Space</h4>
<p>This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant!  Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry! Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems. It's toe-tappingly tragic! I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want! Who are those horrible orange men?</p>
<ol>
<li>Morbo can't understand his teleprompter because he forgot how you say that letter that's shaped like a man wearing a hat.</li>
<li>Guess again.</li>
<li>Do a flip!</li>
<li>Shinier than yours, meatbag.</li>
</ol>
<h5>Bender Gets Made</h5>
<p>And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you? Why, those are the Grunka-Lunkas! They work here in the Slurm factory. Throw her in the brig.</p>
