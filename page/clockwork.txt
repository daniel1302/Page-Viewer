A Clockwork Origin
==================

Moving along… No, she’ll probably make me do it. What are their names?
Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?!

OK, if everyone’s finished being stupid. Take me to your leader!
Calculon is gonna kill us and it’s all everybody else’s fault! Son, as
your lawyer, I declare y’all are in a 12-piece bucket o’ trouble. But I

ol’ mess you caused. This is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind
against me!

-   Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose.
-   Ow, my spirit!
-   You guys realize you live in a sewer, right?

## The Sting

You guys realize you live in a sewer, right? That could be ‘my’
beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play
this stupid thing. Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated
poopers.

## Crimes of the Hot

Hi, I’m a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a
minute. Anyone@example.com you have a dime up your nose. If rubbin’ frozen

saying, it caused him to empty his bowels. Ow, my spirit!

* Hey, what kinda party is this? There’s no booze and only one hooker.
* What are their names?

## My Three Suns

I love this https://www.google.ru/search?q=world! I’ve got wealth, fame, 
and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring. I barely knew 
Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate 
friends all about him. Tell her she looks thin.
