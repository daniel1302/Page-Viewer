<h1>A Leela of Her Own</h1>
<p>Oh, I think we should just stay friends. With gusto. All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit&hellip; that's why I'm transferring to business school! Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused. Ooh, name it after me! Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars.</p>

<p>Bite my shiny metal ass. No! Don't jump! Is the Space Pope reptilian!? THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN! I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope? Ow, my spirit!</p>

<p>In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells. I had more, but you go ahead. You're going to do his laundry? Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun? In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms. Ooh, name it after me!</p>
<ol>
<li>I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want!</li>

<h5>Raging Bender</h5>
<p>Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them. I feel like I was mauled by Jesus. No, just a regular mistake. Oh yeah, good luck with that.</p>
